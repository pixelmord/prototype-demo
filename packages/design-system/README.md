# Prototype Design System

The design system that consists of design artifacts to build consistent applications.

## Style Dictionary

All of the style properties and assets are in this package. Make any changes to suit your needs. This package has web code.

To get started, run

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn prebuild
```

The npm prebuild task is what performs the style dictionary build steps to generate the files for each platform. Every time you change something in the style dictionary, like changing colors or adding properties, you will have to run this command again to generate the files.
